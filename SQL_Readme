SQL: 


One Championship conducts events in a stadium, each event many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, event_name, people_count in a table named events. Id is an auto-increment number.
Take leverage in adding sample data yourself.
Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive events and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive). Consecutive events means three consecutive ids.
